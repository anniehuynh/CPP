/*
Below you can find class "Dog" that is lacking a starting method needed for constructing objects and methods PrintInformation() and Bark(). Make additions to the class so that it becomes possible to construct objects from class. Also make up the missing methods. While being constructed the object will be given values: age, name, race and voice.


class Dog {
   int age;
   string name, race, voice;
   // constructor
   // method PrintInformation()
   // method Bark()
}


The following C++ program uses Dog class printing a print like the example print on screen. The code below doesnÂ’t need to be copied.


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// your code

int main()
{
  Dog buffy(2, "Buffy", "Bulldog", "Hau!!!");
  buffy.PrintInformation();
  cout << "Dog says: " << buffy.Bark();
} 



Example output:
Name: Buffy
Age: 2
Race: Bulldog
Dog says: Hau!!!
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace and is not case-sensitive (the least strict comparison level)

//solution

class Dog {
	public:
   	int age;
   	string name, race, voice;
   	Dog(int new_age, string new_name, string new_race, string new_voice);
   	void PrintInformation();
   	string Bark();
};

Dog::Dog(int new_age, string new_name, string new_race, string new_voice) {
	age = new_age;
	name = new_name;
	race = new_race;
	voice = new_voice;
}
void Dog::PrintInformation() {
	cout <<"Name: " << name << endl;
	cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
	cout << "Race: " << race << endl;
}
string Dog::Bark() {
	return voice;
}
