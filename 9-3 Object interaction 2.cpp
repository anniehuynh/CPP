/*
In the exercise both the main program and the class "Calculator" have been completed. Your task is to make up class "Printer" that asks the user for two integers, calls for the class "Calculator" method "Sum()" transferring the integers received as input to the method. Method "Sum()" calculates the sum of the integers and returns the result. At the end method "Print()" prints the given sum on screen. I.e. the code below doesnÂ’t need to be copied to the answer field.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Calculator
{
  public:

  int Sum(int first, int second);
};

int Calculator::Sum(int first, int second)
{
  int sum =first + second;
  return sum;
}


// your code

int main()
{  
  Printer object;
  object.Print();
} 

Example output:
Give a first integer: 23
Give a second integer: 79
Sum: 102
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace and is not case-sensitive (the least strict comparison level)
*/

//solution

class Printer{
	public:
	void Print();
};

void Printer::Print(){
	int num1, num2, total;
	Calculator calculation; 
	cout << "Give a first integer: ";
	cin >> num1;
	cout << "Give a second integer: ";
	cin >> num2;
	total = calculation.Sum(num1, num2);
	cout << "Sum: " << total << endl;
}
