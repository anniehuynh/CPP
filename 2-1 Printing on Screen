Write a working C++ program that, when started, prints the text: “Hi everybody!” and a line break on screen. After printing the program shuts down.

Tip:
Everything you need can be found in the example program on chapter 2. When you understand how the program works you should be able to do this program as well. Program doesn't require slots i.e. variables.

Example print:

Hi everybody!

//Solution
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "Hi everybody!" << endl;
}
